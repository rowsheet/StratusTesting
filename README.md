# Stratus Test

Performance Test for `www.stratus.co`

I'm consolidating the code to run performance benchmarks and reporting in this repo.
Evntually I will port configuration to a yaml file or something.

## Configuration
Copy `config.yaml.sample` into `config.yaml` and fetch values for your own user session.
You will have to create a Stratus account, log in, and copy the session variables as well as the AWS loadbalancer variables from the cookie or request headers.
